# Neural Network to Predict Bike Sharing Rides

This project is an implementation of a neural network to predict Bike sharing rides for a bike sharing company. Too many bikes means loss if there are few customers, too few bikes means loss of potential paying customers. By analysing historical data, one can use a neural network to predict how many bikes are needed in the near future.
  
Programming language: Python 

### How-To-Repo

    Using Anaconda, create a new conda environment:
        ```create --name dlnd python=3```
    Enter your new environment:
        ```Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
            Windows: >> activate dlnd```
    Install the necessary libraries:
        ```conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook```
    Run the following to open up the notebook:
        ```jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb```
